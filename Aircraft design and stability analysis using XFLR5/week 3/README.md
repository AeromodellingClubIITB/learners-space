## Week 3 
Welcome to week 3!!

Hope you are enjoying the course and exploring XFLR5 for designing aspect of the plane.</br>
As we are done with desighning part of the plane, now we'll look into proper analysis part.

So let’s first discuss stability in general.
There are two types of stability:
* Static
* Dynamic

You can learn about it in deatail [here](https://youtu.be/mGG_LVO5Tis).

With this I hope you have got a decent idea on how stuff looks.
let's go in a bit more detail and understand Airplane's [Longitudinal Stability](https://youtu.be/uReN2Nd1yuo) and Why Stabilizers are needed!</br>
Just a note,In this course, we will only discuss longitudinal static stability (but I will give some resources on lateral one too if you are interested you)

Now before going into actual mathematical stuff,a few concepts that you may need to read upon for better understanding of upcoming topics:
Firstly Simple definition of [center of pressure and aerodynamic center](https://youtu.be/95K7U-BSMtA).

Let's look into these one by one in detail:
* **[Centre Of Pressure](https://youtu.be/3FKN3WfGFYc)**
* **[Aerodynamic center](https://youtu.be/PXznbF9CmC4)**

Depth and mathematical analysis for this will be covered in the webinar.

A few more concepts that will help you to appreciate the concepts: 
* **[Neutral point](https://youtu.be/EXG10AW1WVQ?t=119)** (till 12:10 min)
* **[Static margin](https://youtu.be/NZwqnfXm8cY?t=531)** 

## Implimentaion In XFLR5

The major focus of ours won’t be here to give you an insight on stability by theory we want you to understand how to use XFLR5 for the same.
This will give a better idea for [implimentation part](https://youtu.be/qujlrHkkgtU) (10-12mins) 

If you want to know more about stability then you can go through these content 

* [Content on lateral stability](https://youtu.be/P2QJNgBn6GU)
* [Content on dynamic stability](https://youtu.be/qszrrd_y5ak)
* [XFLR5 + Dynamic stability](https://youtu.be/tc__PDbdcxM)

Though we are not covering this part in webinar, if you are interested you can look into these useful concepts.
